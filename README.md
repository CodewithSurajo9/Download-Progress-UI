## 🚀 How It Works

1. On page load, the progress bar starts filling from 0% to 100% within 5 seconds.

2. Once complete, the title changes from "Downloading..." → "Downloaded."

3. A Theme Toggle Button allows switching between:

- 🌞 Light Mode

- 🌙 Dark Mode
The choice is saved in localStorage, so it persists across reloads.
